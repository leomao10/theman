= theman

The man getting you down?

Theman lets you import lots of data into PostgreSQL very fast.

== Installation

  gem install 'theman'

== Basic usage

Say we have a csv file called <tt>sample.csv</tt> and we want to count how many 
rows we created:

  conn  = PGconn.open(:dbname => 'test')
  
  agent = Theman::Agency.new(conn, 'sample.csv')
  agent.create!

  res = conn.exec("SELECT count(*) FROM #{agent.table_name}")
  res.getvalue(0,0)

== Basic usage with Active Record and a simple object
  
  conn  = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection
  
  agent = Theman::Agency.new(conn, 'sample.csv')
  agent.create!

  model = Theman::Object.new(agent.table_name, ActiveRecord::Base)
  model.count

== Advanced usage with Active Record and an existing model

  conn  = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection

  agent = Theman::Agency.new conn, 'ugly.csv' do |smith|
    smith.nulls /"N"/, /"UNKNOWN"/, /""/
    smith.chop 15
    smith.delimiter "|"
    smith.table do |t|
      t.string :name, :limit => 50
      t.date :date
      t.integer :ext_id
      t.float :amount
      t.boolean :exited
    end
  end
  agent.create!
  MyModel.table_name = agent.table_name
  MyModel.where(:exited => true).count
  
In the above example we omitted the last 15 rows, made some things null and 
specified some column data types.

If you do not provide a table block your columns will be VARCHAR(255); you 
can cherry pick the columns that you want to change the data types for.

The temp table has no id column by default, but you can add one by calling 
<tt>add_primary_key!</tt>, this will add the <tt>agents_pkey</tt> column.

== Drop on commit

If you want to use <tt>ON COMMIT DROP</tt> you will need to pass in 
<tt>:on_commit => :drop</tt> into options and do everthing inside a transacton.

  agent = Theman::Agency.new conn, 'sample.csv', :on_commit => :drop

  agent.transaction do
    agent.create!
    # do stuff
  end

== No headers

If you data does not have headers pass into options <tt>:headers => false</tt>, but 
each column must be specified or the import will fail.

== Dates

Ah dates, the joy! Use datestyle to tell Theman to then tell PostgreSQL:

  agent = Theman::Agency.new conn, 'uber_foie_gras.csv' do |schmit|
    schmit.datestyle 'European'
    schmit.table do |t|
      t.date :start_date
      t.date :end_date
    end
  end

Refer to PostgreSQL docs for more info in the mean time here is some 
copy and paste action:

<b>ISO</b>

Use ISO 8601-style dates and times (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). This is the default. 

<b>SQL</b>

Use Oracle/Ingres-style dates and times. 

<b>PostgreSQL</b>

Use traditional PostgreSQL format. 

<b>German</b>

dd.mm.yyyy

<b>European</b>

dd/mm/yyyy

<b>US</b>

mm/dd/yyyy

== Errors

PostgreSQL <tt>COPY</tt> requires that the data be well formed, any rows that 
are different to what is expected by the table the import will raise a 
<tt>Theman::Agency::Error</tt>.

If you are importing very large files and the import fails space on disc will still
be used untill <tt>VACUUM</tt>.
